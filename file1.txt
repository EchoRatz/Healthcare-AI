Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

The process of machine learning involves feeding data to algorithms, which then identify patterns and make predictions or decisions based on that data. There are three main types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

Supervised learning uses labeled training data to learn a mapping function from input variables to output variables. The algorithm learns from training data and makes predictions on new, unseen data. Common examples include classification and regression problems.

Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data to find hidden patterns or structures. It includes clustering, association rules, and dimensionality reduction techniques. The algorithm must discover the underlying structure in the data without any guidance.

Reinforcement learning is based on the idea of learning through interaction with an environment. An agent takes actions in an environment and receives rewards or penalties, learning to maximize cumulative reward over time.

Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information using connectionist approaches. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, uses neural networks with multiple layers to model and understand complex patterns in data.
