## 🔧 Key Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Reduced Context Processing
- Context length reduced from 3000 to 1500 characters
- Faster keyword extraction with limited Thai healthcare terms
- Efficient knowledge base indexing

### 2. Optimized LLM Parameters
```python
"options": {
    "temperature": 0.3,  # Lower for consistency
    "top_p": 0.8,
    "num_predict": 100,  # Reduced from 500
    "stop": ["\n\n", "Question:", "คำถาม:"]
}
```

### 3. Single-Choice Prompt Engineering
```python
prompt = f"""Based on the following context, answer the question with ONLY ONE choice (ก, ข, ค, or ง).

IMPORTANT: Choose only ONE answer. Respond with just the letter (ก, ข, ค, or ง).

Answer:"""
```

### 4. Efficient Answer Extraction
- Multiple regex patterns for single-choice extraction
- Fallback to first valid choice
- Default to "ง" if no valid answer found

### 5. Batch Processing
- Process questions in batches of 10
- Real-time progress tracking
- Optimized memory usage
